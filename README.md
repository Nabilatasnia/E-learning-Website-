This is an E-learning website. In this project, the goal was to develop a website where people can register and enroll in their desired courses. In this website

- Students are able to register and login
- Students can enroll in different courses
- After enrollment, students get access to video lessons
- Instructors are able to create, edit, and delete courses
- Instructors are also able to manage student database
- Through the paid enrollment process, instructors are able to restrict their course contents

Here are the implemented features of this project-

* Login and Registration: This system has two types of users - instructors and students. The authentication and authorization functionalities were implemented for both types of users. 

* Unique navigation bar for different users: There are three types of navigation bars for the users
      -General layout for unregistered users
      -Login layout for registered students
      -Admin layout for registered instructors

* Resume Session In our website: When a user logs out of his/her session, we have saved a cookie in the browser. By using that, users are able to resume the session when they log in again.

* Student Dashboard: After logging in, students are directed to the dashboard. In the dashboard, students get the list of all their enrolled courses.

* Course Page: The Course page showcases all the available courses. Any unregistered user can browse through the course list. But in order to enroll in the courses, they need to log in. On the other hand, instructors get different types of access to the course list. They can edit or delete the courses. A logged-in user can request enrollment into a course. For that, students will have to pay the course price through mobile banking and provide the transaction ID. Then the instructor will be provided with the list of enrollment requests. By matching the transaction ID, the instructor will approve access to the course.

* Course Creation: The instructors will be able to create courses. Here on the website, the instructor will be able to create new courses by providing course names, descriptions, and images.

* Video Lessons: Each course contains a number of video lessons. Instructors will upload these lessons. A third-party website called Vimeo for this purpose.

* Admin Dashboard: The admin dashboard will display some of the relevant statistics of the website including the number of enrollments on that day, the total number of students and courses.

* Profile edit: Both the students and instructors can edit their names and passwords.

* Feedback: The registered students are able to send their feedback through the ‘Contact Us’ page. The instructors are able to go through the feedback and its sender’s information from their dashboard.
